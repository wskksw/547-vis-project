    "answer": "To find all authors who have written more than one book in relational algebra, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Join the Book and Authors Relations**: Use the Cartesian product and then select the relevant rows where the book's ISBN matches the author's Book_ISBN.\n\n   \\[\n   R1 = σ_{b.ISBN = a.Book\\_ISBN}(Book × Authors)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Project the Author's Details and Book Count**: Project the author's name and the ISBN to prepare for grouping.\n\n   \\[\n   R2 = Π_{a.First\\_Name, a.Last\\_Name, b.ISBN}(R1)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Group and Count**: Since relational algebra does not directly support aggregation like COUNT, you would typically express this conceptually by considering the resulting relation from R2 and acknowledging that you need to group the results and filter based on the count.\n\n4. **Select Authors with More than One Book**: Finally, you would need a hypothetical step to indicate selecting authors with a count greater than one (this part is not explicitly represented in traditional relational algebra).\n\nIn summary, while relational algebra itself does not provide direct aggregation functions, the conceptual operations would involve joining the relations, projecting the necessary fields, and then acknowledging the need for grouping and counting authors based on the derived relations. For practical implementation, SQL is more suitable for such tasks.",
