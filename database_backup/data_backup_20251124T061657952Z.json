If you're running the database locally, it should be `localhost`, but if it's hosted elsewhere, make sure you have the right hostname or IP.\n\n3. **Database Name**: Double-check that the database name in the URL matches the actual name of the database you're trying to connect to.\n\n4. **User Credentials**: Ensure that the username and password you're using are correct and that the user has permission to access the database.\n\n5. **Driver Availability**: Confirm that the JDBC driver for MySQL is included in your project dependencies.\n\nBy checking these aspects, you should be able to identify the issue with your connection.

Here are some hints:\n\n1. **Basic Syntax**: The general form is `DROP TABLE tableName;`.\n\n2. **Caution**: Remember that using `DROP TABLE` will permanently delete the table and all its data. There is no confirmation, so proceed carefully.\n\n3. **Options**: You can include `RESTRICT` or `CASCADE`. Using `RESTRICT` will prevent the drop if the table is referenced by other objects, while `CASCADE` will drop it regardless of dependencies.\n\n4. **Example**: If you want to drop a table named 'emp', you would write `DROP TABLE emp;` \n\nMake sure to check if you need to use `CASCADE` or `RESTRICT` based on your requirements!",

The aliasing (E and M) should accurately reflect the relationships you intend to draw between employees.\n\n2. **EXCEPT Clause**: Look at what each part of the EXCEPT is trying to achieve. The first part retrieves names based on a relationship with supervisors, while the second part retrieves names based on a relationship with managers. Are these two relationships intended to represent complementary or overlapping sets?\n\n3. **Column Selection**: Check that you're selecting the correct columns in both parts of the query. The first part selects `M.ename`, while the second part selects `ename` without an alias. Make sure both parts are referring to the same column.\n\nBy focusing on these points, you can identify where the logic might be failing in your SQL query.",

You will likely want to use a `GROUP BY` clause on the `shippedproduct` table, along with a `JOIN` to connect it to the `product` table.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Shipments**: Use a subquery to calculate the average number of shipments across all products. This will help you identify which products exceed the average.\n\n3. **Filter and Order Results**: In your main query, filter the products based on the comparison with the average number of shipments. Finally, make sure to order the results by the number of shipments in descending order and by product ID in ascending order.\n\nKeep these steps in mind as you construct your SQL query!

Showing a TA in a help session before Monday at 4 p.m. is a 10% bonus and before Wednesday at 4 p.m. is a 5% bonus. The instructor may announce different dates and the bonus may not apply to all labs, so pay attention to class announcements. For example, September 30th is a holiday, so the deadline for a 10% bonus for lab 3 is Tuesday, October 1st. You must attend a help session and show a TA or instructor to get the bonus. The bonus does not apply for early submission on Canvas. This policy is in place to encourage interaction with the TAs/instructor, provide real-time feedback to help learning, and reduce procrastination to allow students to perform their best.",

Right-click on the folder, select \"Properties,\" and then check the \"Security\" tab to ensure your user account has write permissions.\n\n3. **Antivirus/Firewall**: Sometimes, antivirus or firewall settings can block write access. Check if any security software is interfering.\n\n4. **Alternative Location**: If the issue persists, you might consider installing SQuirreL in a different directory where you have full access, such as \"C:\\SQuirreL\".\n\nTry these steps and see if they help resolve your issue!",

If you have a docker-compose file for your SQL Server, look for any environment variables that might define the user ID.\n\n2. **Default Credentials**: If you're using a pre-configured SQL Server image, it often comes with default user IDs and passwords. Check the documentation or the repository from where you obtained the image for any default credentials.\n\n3. **Connection String**: Review the connection string you're using. Make sure it’s formatted correctly and that any parameters are set properly.\n\n4. **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: If you have access to SSMS or a similar tool, you might be able to connect using different methods to find the user ID.\n\n5. **Logs**: Check the SQL Server logs for any additional information on the login attempts. This may provide more context or clues about the issue.\n\nIf you still can't find the user ID, consider reaching out to your instructor or lab supervisor for further assistance.",

It is often used for data interchange between a client and the server. \n\n#### JSON constructs\n- **Values:** number, strings (double quoted), true, false, null\n- **Objects:** enclosed in { } and consist of set of key-value pairs\n- **Arrays:** enclosed in [ ] and are lists of values\n- Objects and arrays can be nested.\n\nAn online JSON validator is [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com).\n\n### Views\n\nA **view** is a named query.  Views may be either virtual or materialized in the database. Advantages of views include data independence, easier querying, improved performance for materialized views, and the ability to enforce security constraints using GRANT/REVOKE on views instead of base tables.\n\n### Triggers\n\nTriggers are also called event-condition-actio",

Connect to MySQL using:\n\n```\nmysql -u root -p\n```\nOR\n```\nmysql -u testuser -p\n```\n\nThe password is given in the `docker-compose.yml` file (which you are **encouraged to change**). Note that all commands are terminated with a semi-colon (`;`). Some useful commands are:\n\n| Function  | Command |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Listing all databases\t  | `show databases;`  |\n| Use database `dbname`  | `use dbname;`  |\n| List all tables  | `show tables;`  |\n\n**Note that if any of the DDL scripts fail to run to setup your database. Then either run them using SQuirreL SQL or login to mysql command prompt and use `source` command such as: `",

However, my course policy is\nthat if you do better on the final exam then that replaces your mark on one or both midterms. \n\nFor example, if you got 70% on the midterm and 80% on the final, your midterm mark is changed to 80%. Even if your mark on the midterm was lower than you wanted, you still can improve that mark by doing well on the final.\n\nAlso, any bonus marks on labs, including if they result in over 100%, go to your overall grade. For example, if you get 22/20 for the assignment component, that extra 2% goes directly to your overall grade.\n\nI am available to answer any questions you have and help you if you feel that your midterm did not reflect your abilities.",

It is human-readable, supports semi-structured data, and has supporting libraries in many programming languages. It is often used for data interchange between a client and the server. \n\n#### JSON constructs\n- **Values:** number, strings (double quoted), true, false, null\n- **Objects:** enclosed in { } and consist of set of key-value pairs\n- **Arrays:** enclosed in [ ] and are lists of values\n- Objects and arrays can be nested.\n\nAn online JSON validator is [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com).\n\n### Views\n\nA **view** is a named query.  Views may be either virtual or materialized in the database. Advantages of views include data independence, easier querying, improved performance for materialized views, and the ability to enforce security constraints using GRANT/REVOKE on views instead of base tables.\n\n### Triggers\n\nTriggers are also called event-condition-actio",

This is accomplished by having a link beside each item. When the user clicks on the link, another page called `addcart.jsp` is called with information on the product to add.\n\n6. The file `addcart.jsp` expects the following parameters: `addcart.jsp?id=(productId)&name=(productName)&price=(productPrice)`.

SQL Server supports most of the SQL standard including foreign keys and triggers.\n\nThe web store that we are going to build allows customers to enter their information, choose products by putting them into a shopping cart, and then place an order.\n\n## Initial Steps\n\n1. To get started with this assignment, download the [starter project code files](304_lab7_starter_node.zip) and follow the [setup instructions](setup/) to create your development environment.\n\n2. Create the tables and load the sample data into your SQL Server database.  The file `/routes/loaddata.js` will load the database using the `/ddl/SQLServer_orderdb.ddl` script.

An autonumber field is an integer field which is automatically assigned by the database.  The value of the counter starts at 1.  When a record is added, the value of the autonumber field for the new record is set to the counter and then the counter is incremented.  Thus, the values of the autonumber field for records are 1,2,3,...  Autonumber fields are useful as primary keys as they are guaranteed to be unique.  To create an autonumber field in a SQL Server create table statement use the `IDENTITY` keyword: \n\n```\nCREATE TABLE dummy (\n   A int NOT NULL IDENTITY,\n   B VARCHAR(50),\n   ....\n   PRIMARY KEY (A)\n);\n```\n## Helpful No"

An autonumber field is an integer field which is automatically assigned by the database.  The value of the counter starts at 1.  When a record is added, the value of the autonumber field for the new record is set to the counter and then the counter is incremented.  Thus, the values of the autonumber field for records are 1,2,3,...  Autonumber fields are useful as primary keys as they are guaranteed to be unique.  To create an autonumber field in a SQL Server create table statement use the `IDENTITY` keyword: \n\n```\nCREATE TABLE dummy (\n   A int NOT NULL IDENTITY,\n   B VARCH"

A transaction in SQL ends by:\n- **Commit** accepts updates of current transaction. \n- **Rollback** aborts current transaction and discards its updates.  Failures may also cause a transaction to be aborted.\n\n#### Java\n\nThere are two options for supporting transactions in Java code. If the entire transaction can be expressed in one SQL string, you can just send the entire transaction as a single string and call `statement.execute(SQLString)`.  However, it is more common that a transaction will consist of a sequence of SQL statements, but you want to have Java code"

To do this, you would calculate the order total and check if it does not match the required total, then update the order total if required.  In JDBC, each statement you execute is a transaction.  You must turn auto-commit off if you want to have transactions that have more than one statement.  Sample code for transactions is in the file [JdbcTransactions.java](code/JdbcTransactions.java).\n"
